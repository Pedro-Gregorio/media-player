# Dummy Media Player

## How to use

1. Install the necessary packages with `npm install` (or pnpm, bun, etc.)
2. Run the dev server with `npm dev` (or pnpm, bun, etc.)

## Description

The media player is entirely dummy and I just made it for fun and to deal with some side effects in React. The songs are from a real Spotify playlist and I left some information about that in `/data/songs.ts`, if you want to take a look at that.

Happy coding!
